# powerAD: Power analysis for affect dynamics studies.
***

This R-package is designed to run power analises for affect dynamics studies. That is, studies analyzing the relationship between trait, variability, instability or affect inertia with other variables. `powerAD` is based on the empirical power estimations presented in Pirla, Taquet and Quoidbach (2021). 

You can read the full paper [here.](https://www.google.com)

You can learn more about the functions included in this package, and how to estimate power and sample size (both participants and affect reports per participant) [here.](https://www.google.com)

We also programmed a Shiny app that runs the main functions included in this package. [Shiny App](https://www.google.com)
