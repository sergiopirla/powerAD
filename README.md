# powerAD: Power analysis for static and dynamic measures of affect.
***

`powerAD` is designed to help researchers construct well-powered and efficient experience-sampling studies. This package covers power analyses for hypotheses regarding dynamic (variability, instability, inertia) or static (average) measures of affect. `powerAD` is based on the empirical power estimations presented in Pirla et al. (2021).

You can learn how to install `powerAD` and how to estimate power and required sample size (both participants and affect reports per participant) [in here.](https://sergiopirla.github.io/powerAD/articles/powerAD.html)

We also programmed a Shiny app that runs the main functions included in this package. [Shiny App](https://sergiopirla.shinyapps.io/powerADapp/)
