# powerAD: Power analysis for affect dynamics studies.
***

This R-package is designed to run power analises for affect dynamics studies. That is, studies analyzing the relationship between trait, variability, instability or affect inertia with other variables. `powerAD` is based on the empirical power estimations presented in Pirla, Taquet and Quoidbach (2021).

You can read the full paper [here.](https://www.google.com)


You can learn how to install `powerAD` and how to estimate power and required sample size (both participants and affect reports per participant) [in here.](https://sergiopirla.github.io/powerAD/articles/powerAD.html)

We also programmed a Shiny app that runs the main functions included in this package. [Shiny App](https://sergiopirla.shinyapps.io/powerADapp/)
